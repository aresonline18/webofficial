## Make.com Automation Setup

### Step 1: Typeform Webhook
Set up Typeform to send data to Make.com including the custom parameters:
- `resources_read` - All resources (comma-separated for Airtable multiple select)
- `conversion_trigger` - The last resource that led to conversion
- `engagement_level` - Low/Medium/High based on resource count
- `resource_count` - Number of resources read

### Step 2: Make.com Processing
```
1. Receive Typeform webhook
2. Parse `resources_read` parameter 
3. Split by comma to get individual resources
4. Map to Airtable multiple select field
5. Set conversion trigger as single select
6. Set engagement level and count
```

### Step 3: Airtable Integration
Map the parsed data to your Airtable fields:
```javascript
// Make.com mapping example
{
  "Resources Read": resources_read.split(", "), // Array for multiple select
  "Conversion Trigger": conversion_trigger,      // Single value
  "Engagement Level": engagement_level,          // Low/Medium/High  
  "Resource Count": parseInt(resource_count),    // Number
  "Lead Score": resource_count * 10              // Optional scoring
}
```
