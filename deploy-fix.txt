Deployment fix for Shadow Pages book image:

1. Added shadow-pages-book-final.png to both client/public and root public
2. Created build-with-assets.sh script to copy public assets during build
3. Updated netlify.toml to use new build script
4. Switched free-resources page to use static resources (no API dependency)

Image should now display properly on deployed site.
